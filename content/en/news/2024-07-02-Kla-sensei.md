Prof.Kla (published papers as Chakkrit Tantithamthavorn) is currently a Senior Lecturer in Software Engineering in the Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Australia visited our laboratory and presentated about software engineering.

**Title:**  
Beyond Publications! How to Create Industry-Relevant and Impactful Research in Software Engineering
**Abstract:**  [text](2024-07-02-Kla-sensei.md)
In the fast-paced world of software engineering, measuring research success solely by the number of publications no longer captures the complete picture of a study's impact. With the burgeoning application of AI and large language models (LLMs) in the field, researchers often prioritize accuracy improvements without sufficiently considering practicality, explainability, and actionability. This oversight hampers the practical adoption of LLM-based tools. Drawing on a decade of my research experience in software engineering, I will explore case studies on how to create industry-relevant and impactful research in software engineering. Finally, I will outline key steps for software engineering researchers to enhance their contributions beyond traditional publications. I hope that this presentation aims to inspire a paradigm shift in how research impact is understood and achieved, fostering pragmatic innovations that benefit both the SE field and society at large.

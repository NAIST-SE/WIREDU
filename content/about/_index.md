# Bio
Raula Gaikovina Kula received the PhD degree from NAIST, Japan in 2013. Originally from Papua New Guinea, I am a Software Engineering researcher. My interests vary from travelling, BBQs, fishing, and some music, sport and leisure along the way!

I was research assistant professor with Osaka University in 2013, then became an Assistant Profesor at NAIST in 2017.

I am now an associate professor with the Nara Institute of Science and Technology (NAIST), Japan at [NAIST-SE](https://naist-se.github.io/).

He is active in the Software Engineering community, serving the community as a PC member for premium SE venues, some as organising committee, and reviewer for journals. Along with my colleagues, we study a wider range of software engineering topics, covering human aspects, documentation, communication, and competency of code by programmers.

# Teaching

Summary of my teaching in NAIST. I currently teach two classes:

1.	(2018~2022). ***Fundamentals of Programming (プログラミング演習 (3002))***. First, we taught the C programming language, but since 2019, we started teaching the Python programing language for beginners. My class introduces the how to use Python third-party libraries (PyPI) in their more advanced classes.

2.	(2018~) ***Software Engineering course (ソフトウェア工学 (4006))***. I teach three classes of Software Engineering fundamentals, related to Software Management using software repositories, software documentation and communication, and then trends in Software Engineering research and Open-Source Software.

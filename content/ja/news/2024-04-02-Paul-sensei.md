Cor-Paul先生が本研究室に訪問され、ソフトウェアに関する発表をしてくださりました。

**Title:**  
Visual quality assurance using foundation models  
**Abstract:**  
An important step of visual quality assurance is the process of detecting visual bugs. Visual bugs are bugs that express themselves visually, i.e., you can detect them by just looking at them. Visual bugs occur in all software, but they are more common in visually-heavy such as GUI-based applications and games. In my lab, we focus on visual quality assurance using foundation models. In my talk, I will give an overview of some of our most recent work on using foundation models for visual bug analysis for games. I will discuss two recent studies and present two datasets containing visual bugs in AAA games which can be used to evaluate your own foundation model.

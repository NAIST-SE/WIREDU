## International Talks

**Coding in the Real World: Teaching Programming Through Open Source Collaboration**

<img align="right" height="200" src="https://ctreude.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/ctreude-1.jpg">

Abstract: Teaching programming often revolves around textbook examples, but what happens when students get to work on real, large-scale projects? In this talk, I will share my experience of teaching an Open Source course to a total of more than 500 students across five instances. This course allows students to contribute to actual Open Source Software development projects, immersing them in the world of coding, communication, and contribution processes that make real software come to life. I'll show examples of the work students have done, illustrating the connection between classroom learning and real-world programming. The course covers various aspects of working on large software projects, such as version control, online collaboration, and continuous software building. The main goals are to teach students practical communication skills in open source, help them understand how large projects function, and foster teamwork in programming. Assessments mirror real-life tasks, including activities like editing Wikipedia and reflecting on lessons learned, all while contributing to open source projects. I hope to inspire ways to make programming education more engaging and relevant, bridging the gap between academic study and the real world of software development.

**Towards Privacy Preserving Cross Project Defect Prediction with Federated Learning**

<img align="right" height="200" src="https://dong-w.github.io/images/wang_new_profile.png">

Abstract: Defect prediction models can predict defects in software projects, and many researchers study defect prediction models to assist debugging efforts in software development. In recent years, there has been growing interest in Cross Project Defect Prediction (CPDP), which predicts defects in a project using a defect prediction model learned from other projects’ data when there is insufficient data to construct a defect prediction model. Since CPDP uses other projects’ data, data privacy preservation is one of the most significant issues. However, prior CPDP studies still require data sharing among projects to train models, and do not fully consider protecting project confidentiality. To address this, we propose a CPDP model FLR employing federated learning, a distributed machine learning approach that does not require data sharing. We evaluate FLR, using 25 projects, to investigate its effectiveness and feature interpretation. Our key results show that first, FLR outperforms the existing privacy-preserving methods (i.e., LACE2). Meanwhile, the performance is relatively comparable to the conventional methods (e.g., supervised and unsupervised learning). Second, the results of the interpretation analysis show that scale-related features have a common effect on the prediction performance of the FLR. In addition, further insights demonstrate that parameters of federated learning (e.g., learning rates and the number of clients) also play a role in the performance. This study is served as a first step to confirm the feasibility of the employment of federated learning in CPDP to ensure privacy preservation and lays the groundwork for future research on applying other machine learning models to federated learning.

Dong Wang is an Assistant Professor from the Principles of Software engineering and programming Languages Lab (POSL) at Kyushu University, Japan.

Research goals are to directly uncover empirical evidence and extract knowledge from data recorded in software repositories. His research topics mainly focus on understanding and improving developer collaboration practices such as code review settings and various communication channels.

**Diversity and Inclusion: Societal considerations for future AI use​**

<img align="right" height="200" src="https://pictures.staff.unimelb.edu.au/fae/index_eis.php?id=862627&t=3&f=j">

Technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), especially in generative systems and large language models (LLMs), allows them to be widely adopted by developers, decision-makers, and end users alike.
Generative systems such as (Chat)GPT and Stable Diffusion -- alongside their non-generative counterparts such as automated image classification and transcription models -- are commonly made available "as-a-service". This leads to lower deployment overheads and allows developers to quickly get up and running with working solutions.
In this talk, I would like to showcase how such systems work, and how they could potentially exhibit bias and discrimination. In particular, this talk focuses on both theoretical (and projected) downstream effects of such technology; in other words, broader implications for the people affected by outputs of these machines, oftentimes beyond that of the deployer. 
While some work has been done to make these systems more inclusive and less biased, there is much more that could be done to improve their outputs. I will highlight examples from existing 'off the shelf' systems, with a case study on hiring and candidate recruitment systems, and potential issues with future systems as they incorporate ever-changing LLMs.
I hope that this talk is able to spur conversation on the societal implications of such technology and promote broader discussion of AI diversity and inclusion in PNG.

**Unlocking the Commons: Lessons from a University EV Sharing Experiment**

<img align="right" height="200" src="https://hideakihata.github.io/img2020.jpg">
Effectively managing community commons is an important challenge today, and finding the sweet spot between the tragedy of the commons and the tragedy of the anti-commons is key to making good use of community commons. In this talk, I will share our experience with the sweet spot from an electric vehicle sharing experiment we are running in the university community.

### BRIDGES Vision and Mission Statement
The objective of the International Workshop on BRIdging Divides with Globally Engineered Software (BRIDGES) is to foster development by providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can report on and discuss issues and solutions to bridge the digital divide of information within a practical geographic-free global software engineering setting.

The workshop encourages the exchange of ideas within the local and international community with its ultimate goal to make software engineering universal; for anyone, anywhere, without any technical, cultural and educational boundaries. This involves a round-table discussion with invited talks from both local and international participants.
